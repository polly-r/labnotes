## Scratch
[Scratch](https://scratch.mit.edu/) is a coding interface for children and a coding language with a simple visual interface that allows young people to create digital stories, games, and animations. It simplifies the coding process with drag-and-drop functionality for all kinds of inputs. It is perfect for intoducing beginners to the world of coding.

## Python
Python is one example, of a high level programming language. Programs written in a high level language must be converted into machine code to run. This is either done ahead of time by converting a whole program to machine code with a compiler program (compiling the code), or line by line as the program runs by an interpreter. 
It is mainly used for web development, data analytics, automation and mathematical computing. It has recently been employed in the AI and Machine Learning fields due its readability and ease of use.
With over 415 000 libraries, Python was designed to be highly extensible as it provides tools to many different types of tasks. Python Package Index ([PyPI](https://pypi.org/)) is the official software repository. It carries software developed and shared by the Python community.
